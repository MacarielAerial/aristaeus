# Toy Project for Argo CD

## Summary

GitOps is an Infrastructure-as-Code paradigm that is not just declarative (Terraform is an example) but also continuously reconciled. Currently, two GitOps tools are widely used with Argo CD being the most popular and mature one. This project demonstrates a local setup of Argo CD that is useful for educational purpose and, with adaptations, for fast and iterative local development of a DevOps project.

A local setup can be useful for two reasons:

1. Fully local systems are fast (e.g. edge computing).
2. Remote system failure or network failure can complicate application development.
